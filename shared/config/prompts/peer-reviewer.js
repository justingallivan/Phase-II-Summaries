**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Please create TWO separate markdown outputs:

**OUTPUT 1 - SUMMARY:**

1. **Review Count**: Start with "We received ${reviewTexts.length} review${reviewTexts.length > 1 ? 's' : ''}"

2. **Grade Summary**: Write a sentence summarizing the grades/ratings from the reviews. Look for ratings like Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor, or numerical scores. If reviewers provide mixed ratings (like "Excellent/Very Good"), note those. Example: "The proposal received two reviews of Excellent, one of Very Good, and one mixed rating of Good/Fair."

3. **Reviewer Details**: Start with "The reviewers were " and list each reviewer's name underlined using <u>Name</u> format, followed by their institutional affiliation in parentheses. If names/affiliations cannot be determined, state "could not be determined from the review documents." After each reviewer, include their general area of expertise if it can be inferred (e.g., "has expertise in bioinformatics").

4. **Overall Tone & Themes**: Provide 2-3 sentences about the overall tone of the reviews and general themes that emerged across reviewers.

5. **Key Quotations**: Provide relevant quotations from each reviewer, ordered from most positive to most critical. Format as:
   - "The most positive reviewer said: '[quote]'"
   - "Another reviewer noted: '[quote]'" 
   - Continue for each reviewer...
   - "The most critical reviewer noted: '[quote]'"

**OUTPUT 2 - QUESTIONS:**

Create a separate section listing all questions, concerns, or issues raised by the reviewers. Format as a bulleted list.

---

**PEER REVIEW TEXTS:**

${reviewTexts.map((text, index) => `**Review ${index + 1}:**\n${text}\n\n---\n`).join('')}

Please provide both outputs as separate markdown sections.`;
