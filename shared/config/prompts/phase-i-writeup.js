  return `You are creating a Phase I proposal writeup for the W.M. Keck Foundation. Analyze the research proposal and generate a concise, well-structured writeup following the exact format below.

**CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**

The writeup MUST follow this exact structure:

1. **Institution Name** (bold, on first line)
2. **Project Title** (italic, one-sentence elevator pitch starting with "To...")
3. **Summary:** section (bold header with colon)
4. **Rationale:** section (bold header with colon, followed by exactly 4 bullet points)

**LENGTH REQUIREMENT:** Approximately 1 page (500-600 words total)

**DETAILED SECTION INSTRUCTIONS:**

**Institution Name:**
${institution ? `The institution is: ${institution}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST write this as: **${institution}**

DO NOT abbreviate, shorten, or modify this institution name in any way.` : `CRITICAL: You MUST extract and use the COMPLETE institution name - never abbreviate or shorten it.`}

**VALIDATION RULE FOR ALL INSTITUTION NAMES (READ THIS CAREFULLY):**
Before you write the institution name, CHECK IT against these rules:
1. If it's just a single word → YOU MADE AN ERROR
2. If it's just a state name like "Arizona", "California", "Colorado", "Montana" → YOU MADE AN ERROR
3. If it's an abbreviation like "ASU", "MIT", "CSU" → YOU MADE AN ERROR
4. The institution name MUST include "University", "Institute", "College", "Hospital", or similar

**COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ WRONG: "Arizona" → ✅ CORRECT: "Arizona State University"
- ❌ WRONG: "Colorado" → ✅ CORRECT: "Colorado State University"
- ❌ WRONG: "Montana" → ✅ CORRECT: "Montana State University"
- ❌ WRONG: "California" → ✅ CORRECT: "California Institute of Technology" or "University of California, [Campus]"
- ❌ WRONG: "Berkeley" → ✅ CORRECT: "University of California, Berkeley"
- ❌ WRONG: "ASU" → ✅ CORRECT: "Arizona State University"
- ❌ WRONG: "MIT" → ✅ CORRECT: "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

Look for the institution name in the proposal header, title page, or PI affiliation section. Write it in bold exactly as it appears, with NO abbreviation.

**Project Title:**
- Write in italics using markdown: *To [verb phrase describing the core research goal]*
- Should be a concise elevator pitch (10-15 words maximum)
- Examples:
  - *To test whether protein fragment accumulation drives the need for sleep*
  - *To harness bacterial immune systems for novel antimicrobial therapy*
  - *To study the ancestral microbes that gave rise to all complex life*

**Summary Section:**
Write a single paragraph (150-200 words) that covers:
- The core hypothesis or innovation being proposed
- The basic mechanism or approach
- The model system or methodology
- What will be tested or studied
- **MUST END with a sentence indicating the major impact if the research is successful**

Use professional, scientific language. Be specific about the research question and approach.

**Rationale Section:**
Provide exactly 4 bullet points in this specific order:

**Bullet 1 - Significance & Impact** (2-4 sentences)
- Why this research matters and what fundamental question it addresses
- The transformative potential if successful
- Broader implications for the field(s)
- Focus on scientific importance, not promotional language

**Bullet 2 - Research Plan** (2-4 sentences)
- Outline the specific aims (use numbered aims: 1), 2), 3)...)
- Describe key methodologies and techniques
- Explain the experimental approach
- Be specific about what will be done

**Bullet 3 - Team Expertise** (2-4 sentences)
- Identify the PI and format name as: "PI <u>[Full Name]</u> is a [lowercase title] of [department] at [institution]..."
- Describe PI's key expertise and qualifications relevant to this project
- If there are Co-PIs, include them: "Co-PI <u>[Full Name]</u> [is/from/brings]..."
- Explain how team expertise is complementary
- DO NOT use promotional language like "world-renowned" or "leading expert"
- INSTEAD state their areas of work factually: "has expertise in...", "specializes in...", "developed..."

**Bullet 4 - Foundation Opportunity** (2-4 sentences)
- LEAD with the opportunity for the Foundation: What is the big win if this research succeeds?
- Explain why funding this project represents a high-impact opportunity
- Emphasize the high-risk, high-reward nature that makes it attractive for foundation support
- If specific information is available about why the project needs foundation support (e.g., too risky for federal funding, program officer feedback, funding constraints, interdisciplinary nature), include that as supporting context
- Frame this as an opportunity to enable transformative research that might not happen otherwise

**TONE AND LANGUAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Use professional, scientific language
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN WORDS**: Never use "paradigm", "paradigm-shifting", "paradigm shift", or any variation
- Avoid promotional terms: "groundbreaking", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "unprecedented", "transformative" (when used as hype)
- Avoid excessive adjectives: "excellent", "outstanding", "remarkable"
- State facts directly without embellishment
- Use format: "The research...", "This project...", "The team will..."
- When describing PIs, state their work factually: "has expertise in X", "developed Y", "specializes in Z"
- Underline PI names using <u>Name</u> tags
- Instead of saying something will "establish a paradigm" or "shift the paradigm", describe the specific change or advancement

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Bold section headers: **Institution Name**, **Summary:**, **Rationale:**
- Italic project title: *To [verb phrase]...*
- Underlined PI/Co-PI names: <u>First Last</u>
- Lowercase academic titles: professor, associate professor, assistant professor
- Bullet points must use standard markdown: • or -
- Each bullet should be substantive (3-5 sentences)

Research Proposal Text:
---
${truncatedText} ${truncationIndicator}

**OUTPUT FORMAT EXAMPLE:**

**[Institution Name]**

*To [concise project title starting with verb]*

**Summary:** [Single paragraph, 150-200 words describing the core research proposal, hypothesis, approach, and what will be studied. Professional scientific tone, specific about the research question and methodology. MUST END with a sentence about the major impact if the research is successful.]

**Rationale:**

• [Bullet 1: Significance & Impact - 2-4 sentences on why this matters, fundamental questions addressed, transformative potential, broader implications]

• [Bullet 2: Research Plan - 2-4 sentences with numbered aims, specific methodologies, experimental approach]

• [Bullet 3: Team Expertise - 2-4 sentences identifying PI <u>Name</u> with factual credentials, Co-PIs if applicable, complementary expertise. Use lowercase titles. State expertise factually without promotional language.]

• [Bullet 4: Foundation Opportunity - 2-4 sentences. Lead with the big win and why this is a high-impact opportunity for the Foundation. Emphasize high-risk, high-reward nature. If available, include specific context about why foundation support is needed (e.g., too risky for federal funding, specific constraints).]
