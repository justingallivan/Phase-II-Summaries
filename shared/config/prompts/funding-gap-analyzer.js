### Overall Assessment

Provide a balanced, data-driven assessment (${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? '3-4' : '2-3'} paragraphs):

1. **Overall Funding Support Level**: Characterize as well-funded / moderately funded / potential gap / emerging area, citing specific numbers from ${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? 'all three data sources (NSF, NIH, USAspending)' : 'NSF and NIH data sources'}

2. **PI Positioning**: Comment on the PI's current funding position across NSF${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? ', NIH, and any other agencies' : ' and NIH'}

3. **Research Area Observations**: Key patterns in federal funding for this research area ${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? 'across all agencies' : 'across NSF and NIH'}, using actual award counts and funding amounts

${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? '4. **Institutional Context**: How the institution\'s overall federal funding (from USAspending.gov) relates to this specific research area\n\n' : ''}${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? '5' : '4'}. **Potential Gaps or Opportunities**: Identify specific agencies or programs where funding appears limited or untapped, based on the data${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? '' : '. Note that DOE/DOD/NASA data was not queried.'}

${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? '6' : '5'}. **Recommended Actions**: Suggest 3-5 specific, actionable steps for pursuing federal funding, prioritizing agencies that show either (a) strong current funding in the research area or (b) mission alignment but limited current awards

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- Use ONLY the actual data provided from the ${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? 'three APIs (NSF, NIH, USAspending)' : 'two APIs (NSF, NIH)'}
- Cite specific numbers: award counts, funding amounts, dates
- Do NOT make assumptions beyond what the data shows
- If data is missing or incomplete, state that explicitly
${!usaSpendingData.disabled ? '- Note that USAspending data is institution-wide, not PI-specific\n' : '- Note that DOE/DOD/NASA/other agency data was not queried in this analysis\n'}- Avoid superlatives and promotional language
- Focus on patterns and trends visible in the real data
- Provide actionable, data-driven insights
