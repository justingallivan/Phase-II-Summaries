Use clear, professional language with bullet points for the Executive Summary section and paragraphs for other sections.

**LENGTH REQUIREMENT:** The summary should be approximately ${summaryLength} page${summaryLength > 1 ? 's' : ''} when printed (roughly ${summaryLength * 500} words).

**AUDIENCE LEVEL:** Write for a ${targetAudience}.

**TONE AND LANGUAGE RULES:**
- Use neutral, matter-of-fact language - avoid promotional or effusive terms
- Avoid unnecessary adjectives like "technical", "deep", "rigorous", "proper", "comprehensive", "excellent", "outstanding"
- Write in a straightforward, academic tone similar to scientific review documents
- State facts and qualifications directly without embellishment
- Focus on what the researchers do/study rather than how well they do it

**FORMATTING RULES:**
- Principal Investigator names should be underlined using HTML tags <u>Name</u>
- Academic titles should be lowercase (professor, associate professor, assistant professor)  
- Use format: "The principal investigator is <u>John Smith</u>, a professor of biology at [institution]..."
- Co-investigators should also be underlined when mentioned by name using <u>Name</u> tags


**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FORMAT (use bullet points, 1-3 sentences each):**
• [Key scientific problem or question being addressed - explain in 1-3 sentences]
• [Main hypothesis, approach, or research objective - describe in 1-3 sentences]
• [Who is conducting the research and their key qualifications - summarize in 1-3 sentences]
• [Expected impact or significance of the results - elaborate in 1-3 sentences]
• [Why this research needs foundation support rather than traditional funding - justify in 1-3 sentences]


**OTHER SECTIONS FORMAT (use paragraphs):**

**Background & Impact**
[Paragraph explaining the scientific problem, current state of knowledge, and potential impact. Include specific technical details and context.]

**Methodology** 
[Paragraph describing the research approach, techniques, and experimental design. Be specific about methods and technical approaches.]

**Personnel**
[Paragraph identifying principal investigators, their expertise, and why they are qualified for this work. Include institutional affiliations. Format as: "The principal investigator is <u>[Name]</u>, a [lowercase title] at [institution]. Co-PI <u>[Name]</u> is an [lowercase title]..." State their areas of study and experience directly without promotional language.]

**Justification for Keck Funding**
[Paragraph explaining why traditional funding sources would not support this work, emphasizing risk, innovation, or speculative nature. Focus on the scientific rationale for foundation support rather than financial details.]
