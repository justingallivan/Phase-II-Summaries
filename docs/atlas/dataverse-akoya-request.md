# Atlas: `akoya_request` (Dataverse, vendor entity + WMKF extensions)

**Last verified:** 2026-05-07 via `scripts/audit-dataverse-state.js`; discriminator/era distributions 2026-05-15 via `scripts/probe-akoya-request-discriminators.js`
**Live row count:** **~25,561** (FetchXML aggregate, 2026-05-15). ⚠️ OData `/$count` returns **5,000** — Dataverse caps `$count` at 5,000; the "5,000" figure is the cap, not the total. Use FetchXML aggregate / RetrieveTotalRecordCount for the true count.
**Entity set:** `akoya_requests`

## Source of truth

**Master grant-request record.** AkoyaGO-vendor-owned core fields + WMKF-added `wmkf_*` extension fields. The lifecycle pivot for proposals — Reviewer Finder, Review Manager, Phase I/II Summaries, Grant Reporting all read here.

**No dedicated adapter** — accessed directly via `DynamicsService.queryRecords` / `DynamicsService.getRecord` / `DynamicsService.updateRecord` from many endpoints and services.

## Key fields (live, sample-probed 2026-05-07)

Identity / status:
- `akoya_requestid` (PK)
- `akoya_requestnum` (e.g. `1002787`) — natural join key, used by Postgres `reviewer_suggestions.request_number`
- `akoya_title`
- `akoya_requeststatus` (String — `Concept Pending | Phase I Pending | Phase II Pending | Accepted | ...`)
- `akoya_requesttype` (Picklist), `wmkf_request_type` (Picklist)
- `akoya_fiscalyear` (e.g. `December 2026`) — joins to `grant_cycles.short_code` via `cycle-code.js`
- `wmkf_meetingdate` (DateOnly)

Money / dates:
- `akoya_request` (requested amount), `akoya_paid`, `akoya_expenses`
- `akoya_loireceived`, `akoya_loiacknowledged`, `akoya_loirequestedamount`
- `akoya_begindate`, `akoya_enddate`
- `akoya_submitdate`, `akoya_submitdatetime`

People (lookups):
- `akoya_applicantid` → `accounts`
- `akoya_payee` → `accounts`
- `akoya_primarycontactid` → `contacts`
- `wmkf_projectleader`, `wmkf_researchleader`, `wmkf_ceo` → `contacts`
- `wmkf_copi1..5` → `contacts` (legacy 5-slot Co-PI roster — superseded by `wmkf_apprequestperson` junction since S139; intake portal pilot will extend that junction with `wmkf_effortpct` / `wmkf_biosketchurl` / `wmkf_lineorder` and expand `wmkf_role` to PI / Co-PI / Senior Personnel / Key Personnel / Other per 2026-05-14 schema review)
- `wmkf_potentialreviewer1..5` → `wmkf_potentialreviewers` (legacy slots — actual reviewer state lives in `wmkf_appreviewersuggestion`)
- `wmkf_programdirector` (lead PD), `wmkf_programdirector2` (secondary, no reviewer assignment role) → `systemusers`
- `wmkf_programcoordinator` → `systemusers`
- `wmkf_grantprogram`, `wmkf_programareaserved` → vendor program entities
- `wmkf_type` → vendor type entity

Content / abstract:
- `wmkf_abstract` (full proposal abstract; added by WMKF, not in vendor schema)
- `wmkf_excludedreviewers` (free-form names)

WMKF AI writeback fields (canonical: `docs/DYNAMICS_AI_FIELDS_SPEC_v3_cn.md` — v2 is archived, do not use):
- `wmkf_ai_summary` (Memo) — Phase I summary text. **Field Set A: ready, live writeback active.**
- `wmkf_ai_dataextract` (Memo, JSON) — domain tags / structured extract. **Field Set A: ready.**
- `wmkf_ai_complianceissues` (Memo, JSON), `wmkf_ai_compliancesummary` (Memo). **Field Set C: ready.** (v3 also reuses existing `akoya_submissionaccepted`.) Note: live probe shows a numeric `wmkf_ai_compliancecheck` field on the entity; per the v3 spec this is part of an earlier draft that Connor is reconciling — do not write to `compliancecheck`, write to `complianceissues` + `compliancesummary`.
- `wmkf_ai_fitassessment` (Picklist) + `wmkf_ai_fitrationale` (Memo) — **Field Set D: ready.** *(⚠️ Label collision pending Connor confirmation: `docs/DYNAMICS_AI_FIELDS_SPEC_v3_cn.md:107` says Field Set D is PD Assignment and writes to existing `wmkf_programdirector` with no new fields. Both fit-assessment fields are deployed and populated live — the deployment isn't in doubt, the label is. Resolve before writing code that targets "Field Set D" by name.)*

**Workflow-chaining fields (S139, deployed `b536121`)** — cached extractions so downstream prompts don't re-parse the narrative:
- `wmkf_ai_keywords` (Memo, JSON array, 4000), `wmkf_ai_methodologies` (Memo, JSON array, 4000), `wmkf_ai_riskflags` (Memo, JSON array, 4000)
- `wmkf_ai_teaminfo` (Memo, JSON object, 8000), `wmkf_ai_budgetsummary` (Memo, narrative, 8000), `wmkf_ai_timeline` (Memo, narrative, 8000)

**Field Set B (Grant Report) — DEPLOYED (S139, `b536121`).** 22 fields covering counts (postdocs / grad students / undergrads / pubs total / pubs peer-reviewed / pubs non-peer-reviewed / patents awarded / patents submitted), narrative summaries (additional funding, project impacts, awards & honors, implications, outcome summary, notes for staff), per-goal JSON (`wmkf_ai_reportgoalsassessment` at 32000 chars — documented exception to the flat-fields convention), top-2 publication triples (`wmkf_ai_reportpub{1,2}{citation,abstract,source}`), and overall rating (Picklist: Successful / Mixed / Unsuccessful). Schema spec: `lib/dataverse/schema/wave2-existing/akoya_request-ai-extensions.json`. Naming follows the v3 rule (`wmkf_ai_<concept>` with no underscore between concept words — so `wmkf_ai_riskflags`, NOT `wmkf_ai_risk_flags`). Wired up to Grant Reporting writeback when staff is ready; field shapes are stable.

**Cruft / do-not-write fields** [VERIFIED via `project_dynamics_ai_writeback.md`]:
- `wmkf__ai_summary` (double underscore) — exists alongside the real `wmkf_ai_summary`; Connor will delete. Do not target.
- `wmkf_ai_rundatetime` on `wmkf_ai_run` — vestigial; use built-in `createdon` instead.

WMKF status / flags (the long tail):
- `wmkf_phaseistatus` (Picklist), `wmkf_phaseiicheckincomplete` (Picklist), `wmkf_phistaffversioncompleteflag`
- `wmkf_readyforreview`, `wmkf_galreadyforreview`, `wmkf_pcgoverifycomplete` (Picklist)
- `wmkf_vendorverified` (Picklist), `wmkf_rationalesummarycompleted`
- `wmkf_groupexempt`, `wmkf_organizationisgovernmententity`, `wmkf_california`, `wmkf_caftb`, etc. — eligibility booleans

Sample row had **364 total fields** (vendor + WMKF + standard Dataverse audit fields). Most fields are vendor-owned and not touched by app code.

## Read paths (high-traffic)

- `lib/services/dynamics-service.js` (canonical client, all reads route here)
- `pages/api/dynamics-explorer/*` — natural-language query
- `pages/api/grant-reporting/*` — final-report extraction + writeback
- `pages/api/phase-i-dynamics/summarize.js` — Phase I summary writeback
- `pages/api/review-manager/*` — reviewer lifecycle
- `pages/api/reviewer-finder/{load-proposal,my-candidates,save-candidates}.js` — `load-proposal.js` (≈line 73) `getRecord('akoya_requests', requestId, { select: 'akoya_requestid,akoya_requestnum' })` to resolve request number for the SharePoint proposal lookup that follows
- `pages/api/grant-reporting/lookup-grant.js` — request lookup for Grant Reporting (`reviewer-finder/lookup-grant.js` does not exist; the original Atlas citation was wrong)
- `pages/api/reviewer-finder/my-proposals.js` (≈lines 80, 131) — `DynamicsService.queryAllRecords('akoya_requests', ...)` to list Phase-II-Pending proposals for the picker; cycle and PD filters applied
- `pages/api/expertise-finder/*`
- (NOT `pages/api/integrity-screener/*`, NOT `pages/api/virtual-review-panel.js` — both read no Dataverse. `integrity-service.js` imports only Postgres `sql`; `virtual-review-panel.js` is a single file (not a directory) that's PDF-upload-driven and Postgres-backed via `PanelReviewService`.)
- `lib/dataverse/adapters/reviewer-suggestion.js` `findByPD` — joins requests by lead PD

## Write paths (verified 2026-05-07)

- `pages/api/phase-i-dynamics/summarize.js` — writes ONLY `wmkf_ai_summary` (≈line 192) with pre-flight overwrite guard. The endpoint header comment defers `wmkf_ai_dataextract` (structured JSON) to "a later pass" — do not assume it writes structured fields.
- `lib/services/execute-prompt.js` (≈line 511) — Executor contract writer. **Dynamically writes to whichever `akoya_request` field the prompt's `target.field` declares.** Used by `pages/api/phase-i-dynamics/summarize-v2.js`. Same overwrite-guard pattern. This is the canonical AI writeback path going forward; phase-i-dynamics/summarize.js is the legacy direct path.
- (Dynamics Explorer does NOT write — its 11 tools are read-only: search, get_entity, get_related, describe_table, query_records, count_records, aggregate, find_reports_due, list_documents, search_documents, export_csv. The `dynamics_restrictions` table exists but no write-tools are wired in.)

> **Codex R7 corrections (2026-05-07):**
> - `pages/api/grant-reporting/extract.js` historically wrote only the `wmkf_ai_run` audit log row (the line 526 comment *"wmkf_ai_run row is therefore the ONLY durable copy of"* extracted data reflects that prior state). Field Set B fields were DEPLOYED on `akoya_request` 2026-05-07 (22 fields, see `docs/INTAKE_PORTAL_SCHEMA_CHANGES.md`); wiring `grant-reporting/extract.js` to write the flat fields is a follow-up.
> - `pages/api/integrity-screener/*` writes screenings to **Postgres** `integrity_screenings` via `IntegrityService.saveScreening`; no `akoya_request` writes exist anywhere in integrity-screener or integrity service files.

All user-driven writes use `MSCRMCallerID` (impersonation contract per `docs/DYNAMICS_IDENTITY_RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md`); preview + prod flag now ON.

## Junction relationship (S139)

`wmkf_apprequestperson` is the new PI/co-PI history junction (5,561 rows after backfill). UNION-read with `_wmkf_projectleader_value` per `pages/api/reviewer-finder/contact-history.js`. Connor's PA flows (not yet shipped) will dual-write the junction alongside the projectleader lookup on create/update. Until then, the legacy `wmkf_copi1..5` slot lookups remain the only co-PI write path. Full details: [`atlas/dataverse-wmkf-apprequestperson.md`](dataverse-wmkf-apprequestperson.md).

## SharePoint linkage

`sharepointdocumentlocation` rows linked via `_regardingobjectid_value`; folder pattern `{requestNumber}_{guidNoHyphensUpper}`. Multiple libraries: `akoya_request` (active) + `RequestArchive1/2/3` (migrated). See `lib/utils/sharepoint-buckets.js` and `project_dynamics_explorer_archive_libs.md`.

## Cross-system

| Postgres | Dataverse | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `reviewer_suggestions.request_number` | `akoya_request.akoya_requestnum` | natural join key |
| `proposal_searches.request_number` | same | (table empty) |
| `grant_cycles.short_code` | derives from `akoya_request.wmkf_meetingdate` via `cycle-code.js` | not stored on request |

## Polymorphism & era distribution (live-probed 2026-05-15)

`akoya_request` is **polymorphic** — "grant" is a *view* over it, not the entity. No single discriminator; it is a **composite** of `wmkf_request_type` × `wmkf_grantprogram` × `akoya_requesttype`. Counts via FetchXML aggregate (within the 50k aggregate reliable range):

- `akoya_requesttype` (Picklist): `Grant` 25,473 · `Scholarship` 88 · (`Interfund`/`Program Expense` defined but unused). Too coarse to use alone.
- `wmkf_request_type` (Picklist): `Request` 16,227 · `Concept` 3,273 · `Office Visit` 2,826 · `Site Visit` 1,528 · `Phone Call` 914 · *null* 706 · `Individual` 87. **`Concept` = feedback-only, not a funding ask. Office/Site Visit + Phone Call (~5,268) are interaction logs, not grants.**
- `wmkf_grantprogram` (lookup): `Research` 8,500 · `Discretionary` 5,345 · *null* **4,634** · `Southern California` 4,489 · `Undergraduate Education` 2,017 · `Young Scholars` 326 · `Honorarium` 87 · `Law` 62 · `Strategic Fund` 47 · `Other` 43 · `Emeritus` 7 · `Memorial` 4. **SoCal is its own large separate-process program; Discretionary is high-volume staff-directed giving; ~4,634 rows have NO program (data-quality hole for "all grants to X").**
- `akoya_requeststatus` (String): 24 live values — `Closed` 7,479 · `Phase I Declined` 5,905 · `Concept Done` 3,047 · `Office Visit` 2,826 · `Site Visit` 1,528 · `Phone Call` 914 · `Approved` 766 · `Phase II Declined` 707 · … (interaction types also appear here as status — overlapping/messy). Note the 2026-05-07 "Key fields" line listing `Accepted` is stale — no live `Accepted`; closest is `Approved`.
- `statecode`: 0 (active) 25,518 · 1 (inactive) 43.

**Era — boundary is precise and Dataverse-derived (2026-05-16, `scripts/probe-akoya-createdon-2023.js`):** `createdon` by year — **2023: 22,573** · 2024: 1,167 · 2025: 1,376 · 2026: 445. Day-level drill: **100% of the 2023 cohort (22,573 rows) was created on a single date, 2023-12-03**, within one ~43-minute window (`2023-12-03T17:42:10Z … 2023-12-03T18:25:32Z`). Zero native creates anywhere in 2023; the 2,988 native rows are all 2024+ (1,167 + 1,376 + 445 = 2,988; 22,573 + 2,988 = 25,561 ✓). Unambiguous single bulk-import event. **Practical native-vs-migrated classifier (no external dependency): `createdon` on 2023-12-03 ⇒ migrated/historical; `createdon` after 2023-12-03 ⇒ Akoya-native (clean, Connor-authoritative).** The *system* create date of migrated rows is gone — `overriddencreatedon` is **null on 100% of rows (0 / 25,561)** (DISCONFIRMED as an era marker, 2026-05-16 `scripts/probe-akoya-overriddencreatedon.js`, FetchXML aggregates not `$count`). **But the true business history was preserved in a domain field — see below.** Connor / AkoyaGo are a **cross-check on the 2023-12-03 go-live**, no longer a blocker for the era classifier. The earlier "cutover ~2023, confirm with Connor" / "inconclusive `overriddencreatedon`" framings are superseded.

**Era field-shape — what changed Blackbaud→AkoyaGO (2026-05-16; rates are EXACT full-cohort FetchXML aggregates from `scripts/probe-akoya-export-col-rates.js`, migrated tot=22,573 / native tot=2,988).** The prior grant system was **Blackbaud (a.k.a. "Sky")**; the 2023-12-03 import was the cutover. ⚠️ The initial `probe-akoya-era-field-shape.js` n=1,200 GUID-ordered sample was **proven biased** in the migrated cohort (`probe-akoya-era-robustness.js`: `akoya_grant` asc 95% / desc 61%; `grantprogram` asc 58% / desc 99%) — exact rates below supersede it. **Historical key:** `akoya_decisiondate` is **100% migrated / 31% native** with a reproducible realistic spread (1950s:6 · 1980s:1,929 · 2000s:5,249 · 2010s:7,636 · 2020s:3,646; **zero pre-1954** — Keck founded 1954; `probe-akoya-era-robustness.js` block d); the reliable historical-year key for the migrated cohort (mirror `wmkf_meetingdate`), *not* `createdon` (collapsed) or `akoya_datereceived` (7% mig). **Measured ≥97% both cohorts:** `akoya_requestnum` (human Request #), `akoya_requesttype`, `wmkf_request_type` (97/99), `akoya_requeststatus`, `statecode`, `akoya_applicantid` (100/97), `wmkf_meetingdate`, `akoya_fiscalyear`, `akoya_paid` (`akoya_programid` 99/80 just below). **Amount-field gap is field-specific:** `akoya_grant`/`akoya_originalgrantamount` 84% mig / ~32% nat = **confirmed lifecycle confound** (native-decided 95% / 99% resp., not-decided ≈3% — both stratified, `probe-akoya-era-robustness.js` block c); `akoya_request`/`akoya_expenses` 100% mig / ~46% nat = **NOT lifecycle** (decided ≈ not-decided ≈46% — structural/migration gap, cause UNVERIFIED, needs Connor). **Full table + 5-bucket classification + disclosure spec: `docs/DATAVERSE_POWER_TOOLS_DESIGN.md` → "Artifact 3".** **Net-new in AkoyaGO (~28 fields, 0% migrated by nature, not loss):** the GOapply online-intake + review-workflow layer (`akoya_goapply*`, `wmkf_readyforreview`, eligibility/completion flags, `akoya_requestsource`, `akoya_submitdatetime`). **Blackbaud lineage retained as columns:** `wmkf_bbstatus` (BB Status, mig 100/nat 9) + `wmkf_bbstaffid` (BB Staff ID, mig 90/nat 10) — secondary migrated-cohort confirmation; `_wmkf_programlevel2_value` the lone migrated-only field. The earlier "Bucket C = Blackbaud didn't capture this" framing is **retracted** — exact rates (`wmkf_grantprogram` 80/99, `akoya_primarycontactid` 70/77) are substantively present in both eras; the migrated shortfall's cause is not isolated.

## Migration disposition

Stays as the system of record. WMKF AI fields and lifecycle additions are merged into the vendor entity, not extracted.

## Open questions / gotchas

- **~25,561 rows** (not "5,000" — that is the OData `$count` cap; see header). Many vendor-only fields not in our scope. Don't accidentally touch fields outside the WMKF-owned set.
- The 5-slot `wmkf_copi1..5` and `wmkf_potentialreviewer1..5` patterns are vendor-conceived but feel artificial — they're being phased out via child entities (`wmkf_apprequestperson` extended per 2026-05-14 schema review for roster, `wmkf_appreviewersuggestion` for reviewer state). Code that reads slots directly should be flagged for migration.
