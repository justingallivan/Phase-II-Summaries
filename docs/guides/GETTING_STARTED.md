# Getting Started

Welcome to the Document Processing Suite — a collection of AI-powered tools for managing grant proposals, peer reviews, and research workflows.

## Signing In

The suite uses your organization's Microsoft account for authentication.

1. Navigate to the application URL
2. Click **Sign In** — you'll be redirected to Microsoft's login page
3. Sign in with your organizational credentials
4. You'll be redirected back to the home page

## Home Page

After signing in, you'll see the home page with cards for each application you have access to. Click any card to open that app.

Apps are organized into categories:
- **Concepts** — Evaluate early-stage research ideas
- **Phase I** — Process and summarize Phase I proposals
- **Phase II** — Process and summarize Phase II proposals
- **Other** — Specialized tools (expenses, literature, CRM queries, integrity screening)

## Default Access

New users start with limited access. An administrator will grant you access to the applications you need from the Admin dashboard. To request access, email [jgallivan@wmkeck.org](mailto:jgallivan@wmkeck.org).

## Navigation

- The **top navigation bar** lists all apps you can access
- On mobile, tap the hamburger menu to see the full navigation list
- The **Home** link always returns you to the main dashboard
- Your user avatar in the top-right opens profile settings and sign-out options

## Getting Help

- Each complex app has a **?** help button that links to its guide section
- The **Guide** link in the page footer opens the full in-app documentation
- For technical issues or access requests, email [jgallivan@wmkeck.org](mailto:jgallivan@wmkeck.org)
