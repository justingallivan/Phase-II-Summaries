# Review Manager Guide

Manage the peer review lifecycle from sending materials through collecting completed reviews.

## Overview

The Review Manager picks up where the Reviewer Finder leaves off. Once reviewers have accepted an invitation, the Review Manager helps you:

1. **Send review materials** (proposal documents, review templates)
2. **Track reviewer status** through a pipeline
3. **Send reminders** to reviewers who haven't responded
4. **Send thank-you emails** after reviews are submitted
5. **Upload completed reviews** for storage and access

## Getting Started

### Select a Grant Cycle and Proposal

1. Choose a **Grant Cycle** from the dropdown at the top
2. Select a **Proposal** — the list shows proposals that have accepted reviewers in that cycle
3. The reviewer list loads with each reviewer's current status

## Status Pipeline

Each reviewer moves through these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Accepted** | Reviewer agreed to review — ready to send materials |
| **Materials Sent** | Review materials have been emailed to the reviewer |
| **Review Received** | The completed review has been uploaded |
| **Reminded** | A reminder email was sent |
| **Thanked** | A thank-you email was sent after receiving the review |

Click the status badge on any reviewer card to manually update their status.

## Sending Materials

1. Select one or more reviewers with **Accepted** status
2. Click **Send Materials**
3. The system generates .eml files with:
   - The proposal summary (extracted during Reviewer Finder analysis)
   - The review template (configured in Reviewer Finder settings)
   - A personalized cover message
4. Download and send the .eml files from your email client

## Sending Reminders

1. Select reviewers with **Materials Sent** status who haven't submitted reviews yet
2. Click **Send Reminder**
3. A reminder .eml file is generated referencing the original deadline
4. Download and send from your email client

## Sending Thank-You Emails

1. Select reviewers with **Review Received** status
2. Click **Send Thanks**
3. A thank-you .eml file is generated
4. Download and send from your email client

## Uploading Completed Reviews

When a reviewer submits their review:

1. Find the reviewer in the list
2. Click **Upload Review**
3. Select the review document (PDF or Word)
4. The file is stored and the reviewer's status updates to **Review Received**
5. A download link appears on the reviewer's card

## Notes and URLs

Each reviewer card has:
- A **Notes** field — add reminders, track communications, note conflicts
- A **URL** field — link to an external resource (e.g., a shared document)

Changes save automatically when you click outside the field.

## Tips

- The email templates use the same settings configured in the Reviewer Finder (sender info, signature, grant cycle details)
- Use the notes field to track phone calls, special arrangements, or deadline extensions
- You can send materials to multiple reviewers at once by selecting them all before clicking Send
