# Dynamics Explorer — Schema Annotation Reference

> **Scope (clarified 2026-05-08).** This doc records the field annotations baked into the **Dynamics Explorer** chat tool's `TABLE_ANNOTATIONS` — what the Explorer's LLM "knows" about each table. It is not a full schema dump.
>
> **Authoritative live schema** for any table or entity-set lives in `docs/APPLICATION_STATE_ATLAS.md` and the per-entity pages under `docs/atlas/dataverse-*.md`. The Atlas is CI-gated; this doc is not. If they conflict, trust the Atlas.
>
> **Intentionally excluded from this doc / TABLE_ANNOTATIONS:**
> - `wmkf_ai_run` (operational AI audit log, not business data — should not surface in natural-language queries)
> - `wmkf_ai_prompt` (staff-edited prompt store; surface via prompt-resolver, not chat search)
> - The `wmkf_ai_*` flat fields on `akoya_request` (Field Sets A/C/D + Set B reporting + 6 workflow-chaining) — these are AI-output fields, documented in `docs/atlas/dataverse-akoya-request.md`. They are not annotated here because Explorer users typically want CRM fields, not AI summaries.
>
> If TABLE_ANNOTATIONS-driven Explorer behavior needs a refresh, regenerate via `scripts/dynamics-schema-diff.js` (NOT the older `dynamics-schema-map.js`, which samples 25 records and silently drops sparsely-populated fields — that's how `wmkf_ai_summary` was missed until 2026-05-05).

## Overview

This document records the field-level understanding of the akoyaGO Dynamics 365 CRM schema. It was created as a planning doc (Session 54) and fully resolved through comprehensive database introspection (Session 84). All annotations are now implemented in `shared/config/prompts/dynamics-explorer.js` via `TABLE_ANNOTATIONS`.

## Architecture

- **System prompt** (~800-1000 tokens) — lean vocabulary, default filters, and key GUIDs
- **TABLE_ANNOTATIONS** — per-table field metadata returned on-demand via the `describe_table` tool
- **Search-first** — Dataverse Search discovers records; OData queries retrieve details

## Database Scale

- **89 entities** with data out of 1,683 total Dataverse entities
- **15 tables** annotated in TABLE_ANNOTATIONS (covering all commonly queried data)

## Annotated Tables

### 1. akoya_request — Universal Record Table (25,000+)

Not just grants — this table holds **all record types**: grant applications (16K), concepts (3K), office visits (2.8K), site visits (1.5K), phone calls (914), and individual grants (86). The `wmkf_request_type` option set distinguishes them.

**Default filter rule:** Always add `wmkf_request_type eq 100000001` unless the user asks for concepts, visits, or all records.

### 6. Program Hierarchy

Three-level hierarchy for classifying grants:

```
wmkf_type (8 broad classifications)
  ↕ many-to-many in practice
wmkf_grantprogram (11 grant programs)
  ↓ parent-child
akoya_program (24 internal programs)
```

**wmkf_type** (8 values): Program, Discretionary, Site Visit, Office Visit, Special Projects, Special Grants, Miscellaneous, Individual.

**wmkf_grantprogram** (11 values): Research (RES), Southern California (SOCAL), Undergraduate Education (UE), Discretionary (DISC), Law (LAW), Young Scholars (YS), Strategic Fund (STRAT), Honorarium (HON), Emeritus (EMER), Memorial (MEM), Other (MISC).

**akoya_program** (24 values): S&E, MR (under Research); HC, CC, EC, EP, AC (under SoCal); LA (under Law); UG (under UE); CGP, DDGP, DMGP, EMGP, SDGP, SSDGP (under Discretionary); and others. Some newer programs (DR=Disaster Relief, BR=Bridge Funding, RR=Research Reviewer) lack parent links.

---

### 7. Lookup/Reference Tables

| Table | Count | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `wmkf_bbstatus` | 88 | Status codes with request type mapping |

| `akoya_concept` | Defunct (75 records). Concepts now stored in `akoya_request` with `wmkf_request_type = Concept`. |
| `akoya_goverify` | Tax/compliance fields are duplicated on `account`. No need to query this table directly. |

---

## Key Business Logic

### Alternate Payee Pattern
An applicant institution may not be eligible to receive payment due to tax status. In that case, the foundation pays the institution's associated fundraising organization (the "payee"). Tracked by:
- `wmkf_usingpayee` on akoya_request (boolean flag)
- `_akoya_payee_value` on akoya_request (payee org lookup)
- `akoya_alternatepayee` on akoya_requestpayment (per-payment flag)

### Status Lifecycle
`akoya_requeststatus` is the meta status. The concept and phase status fields provide granular outcomes:
1. **Concept stage** → `wmkf_researchconceptstatus` or `wmkf_socalconceptstatus`
2. **Phase I** → `wmkf_phaseistatus` (outcome: Invited → Phase II, or Not Invited/Ineligible)
3. **Phase II** → `wmkf_phaseiistatus` (outcome: Approved, Declined, Deferred, Withdrawn)

### Fiscal Year
`akoya_fiscalyear` stores labels like "June 2025", not calendar years. Filter with `contains()` or combine with date range on `akoya_submitdate`.

### Payment vs Requirement
The `akoya_requestpayment` table holds two unrelated record types differentiated by `akoya_type`. Always specify which type when querying.

## Implementation

All annotations are implemented in:
- **`shared/config/prompts/dynamics-explorer.js`** → `TABLE_ANNOTATIONS` object and `buildSystemPrompt()` function
- **15 tables** fully annotated with field descriptions, types, option set values, and query rules

Last updated: 2026-05-08 (status-clarification pass; underlying TABLE_ANNOTATIONS unchanged since Session 84)
